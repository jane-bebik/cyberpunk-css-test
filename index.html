        I couldn't wait for you to come and clear the cupboard<br>
        But now you're gone and leaving nothing but a sign<br>
        Another evening I'll be sitting reading in between your lines<br>
        Because I miss you all the time<br>
        So, get away<br>
        Another way to feel what you didn't want yourself to know<br>
        And let yourself go<br>
        You know you didn't lose your self-control<br>
        Let's start at the rainbow<br>
        Turn away<br>
        Another way to be where you didn't want yourself to go<br>
        And let yourself go<br>
        Is that a compromise?<br>
        So, what do you wanna do, what's your point of view?<br>
        There's a party, screw it, do you wanna go?<br>
        A handshake with you, what's your point of view?<br>
        I'm on top of you, I don't wanna go<br>
        'Cause I really wanna stay at your <span class="highlight">House</span><br><br>
        And I hope it all works out<br>
        But you know how much you broke me apart<br>
        I'm done with you, I'm ignoring you<br>
        I don't wanna know, ahh<br>
        And I'm awarе that you were lying in the gutter<br>
        'Cause I did everything to be there by your side-ide<br>
        So when you tell me I'm the reason, I just can't believe the lies<br>
        And why do I still wanna call you (call you, call you, call you)<br>
        So, what do you wanna do, what's your point of view?<br>
        There's a party, screw it, do you wanna go?<br>
        A handshake with you, what's your point of view?<br>
        I'm on top of you, I don't wanna go<br>
        'Cause I really wanna stay at your <span class="highlight">House</span><br><br>
        And I hope it all works out<br>
        But you know how much you broke me apart<br>
        I'm done with you, I'm ignoring you<br>
        I don't wanna know<br>
        Ohh<br>
        Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh<br>
        I don't know why I'm no one<br>
        So, get away<br>
        Another way to feel what you didn't want yourself to know<br>
        And let yourself go<br>
